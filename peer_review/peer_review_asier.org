* Summary of the paper

Microwave drivers are key electronic components of the architectures
that control experimental quantum processors. As quantum computers
scale up to sizes necessary for fault-tolerance, the use of
conventional room-temperature controls face new challenges. The paper
introduces and outlines approaches to scaling up control while
limiting delay times (by bringing control architectures closer to the
quantum processor) and keeping the number of control lines small
(scaling sub-linearly with number of qubits). A review of the
state-of-the-art mentions two key recent developments in cryogenic
microwave driver technology.

* Quality of the content

** Have all points been addressed?
   
*** Are microwave drivers required for solid-state qubits?
    yes

*** Room temperature vs cryogenic MW drivers: pros and cons.
    Room tempreature long delays (10ns). Thermal load due to cabling posses a
    challenge in refrigerators. 

    Cryogenic. Limited cooling power. 
    
*** Advantages and requirements of FDMA.

*** Implications of cryogenic electronics on MW driver design.

** Other important points that have been treated

** Analysis of state of the art
   They analyze the implementation of the of two microwave controllers at
   cryogenic temperatures (4K). The main ideas are that optimizations are made
   to reduce power consumption but the power consumption is still one order of
   magnitude greater that the proposed limit by Bardin et al. Experiments
   performed with these controllers show that relaxation time and leakage was
   not deteriorated. Horse Ridge's pulse modulator is even improved with
   respect to Google≈õ one by introducing FDMA. Cross talk seems a problem but
   they do not go far into it.
   
   
   A quick overview of the microwave controller with its main components would
   have helped reading the state of the art section.
