Quantum error correction, and its realization experimentally, remains a key
milestone in the development of a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer.
Progress in the development of high threshold error correcting codes, especially
the surface code, and the fault-tolerant application of quantum gates at the
logical level, provide a possible road-map to a truly universal quantum
computer.

Many challenges have yet to be addressed, though.
