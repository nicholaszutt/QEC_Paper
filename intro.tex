Quantum computers are devices that exploit the features of quantum mechanics at
the smallest scales of reality. They have the potential to solve computational
problems that are not feasible on conventional computers
\cite{nielsen_chuang_2010}, including the accurate simulation of physics
\cite{feynman82_simul_physic_with_comput}, fast database searching provided by
Grover's algorithm \cite{Grover_1996} and Shor's polynomial time algorithm for
factoring large composite numbers \cite{Shor_1997}. However, there are still key
challenges that need to be overcome before a truly universal quantum computer
can be realized.


To date, superconducting LC circuits have shown the greatest promise in forming
effective quantum bits (or qubits)
\cite{Rol_2019, barends14_super_quant_circuit_at_surfac}, however several other
platforms, such as quantum dots \cite{huang19_fidel_bench_two_qubit_gates_silic}
\cite{Lawrie_2020}, NV-centres in diamond \cite{Taminiau_2014}, and even
topological qubits in semi-conducting nanowires \cite{Mourik_2012}, have seen
growing interest and recent development. Nevertheless, all these systems suffer
from some form of noise, of a slightly different nature in each case, which
poses major challenges in the realization of a scalable quantum computer.

Different approaches have been developed to address these systems'
susceptibility to noise. \textit{Quantum error suppression} (QES) methods, such
as dynamical decoupling, attempt to reduce the noise at the hardware level,
while \textit{quantum error correction} (QEC) techniques, aim to correct errors
by sharing the logical qubit's state among a set of highly entangled
physical qubits. The latter approach has undergone rapid development in recent
decades from the first proposed schemes by Shor \cite{Shor_1995_QEC} and Steane
\cite{Steane_1996_QEC} to the new promising \textit{surface codes}
\cite{fowler12_surfac_codes} that have higher tolerance to errors and require
fewer interactions among the qubits.

In this article, we will introduce the surface code and review the key
principles of quantum error correction as they relate to this code, including
the fault-tolerant encoding of physical qubits with error rates below their
threshold values. We then briefly present some of the current progress toward
experimental realizations of the surface code on superconducting qubits and
silicon quantum dots, before discussing promising next steps toward implementing
multiple encoded qubits for QEC on a single 2D surface code. We first turn our
attention to the surface code.

\subsection{Surface codes}

    qubits are white circles, each of which are connected to 2 $Z$- (green)
    and 2 $X$- (yellow) stabilizers respectively. The figure defines the logical
    operations $Z_L = Z_6Z_7Z_3Z_8Z_9$ (red) and $X_L = X_1X_2X_3X_4X_5$ (blue)
    that anti-commute. The purple line is a \textit{stabilizer},
    $X_s = X_2 X_{10}X_{11} X_{12} $, an operation that does not affect the
    logical state of the qubit. Figure from \cite{fowler12_surfac_codes}.}

\end{figure}

Surface codes, a class of topological stabilizer codes, implement error
correction through a 2D array of qubits on a lattice, as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:surface_code}. Computational states are stored in the \textit{data
  qubits} (white circles), whereas the \textit{ancillary qubits} (black circles)
perform parity measurements to check for errors. 

Surface codes have very high error thresholds (around 1\%) \cite{terhal15} and
implement QEC cycles that require only nearest neighbour interactions, greatly
reducing the complexity involved in implementing the two-qubit gates necessary
for parity measurements. This simplifies the process of scaling up to larger
system sizes, which combined with the planar structure of the surface code,
makes it a natural choice for experimentalists when compared to other QEC codes
(for instance, Kitaev's more topologically complex toric code \cite{Kitaev_2003}
or Steane's 7-qubit code \cite{Steane_1996_QEC}).
